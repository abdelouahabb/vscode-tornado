## How to use
Easy, the extension has two parts:

 
2.  The syntax highlight, just put it in the extension folder
3.   The snippets, past it in the `Tornado.json` snippets configuration.

## Brief history

After switching to VSCode, found that it was easier, and the snippets are exactly like the one in Atom, and to make the syntax highlighting, it was the easiest step:



- `npm install -g yo generator-code`



- `yo code`

- And then choose `New language
support`

- Then past [TextMate Django link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/textmate/python-django.tmbundle/master/Syntaxes/HTML%20(Django).tmLanguage "TextMate ")
- Then, just edit your `tmLanguage` and put the `Tornado` keywords, you can also convert it to `json` by [this online tool](http://json2plist.sinaapp.com/ "This online tool")
